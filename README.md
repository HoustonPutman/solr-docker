# NOTE: Not vulnerable to Log4J 2 "Log4shell"

Some Docker images *were* vulnerable to one of a pair of vulnerabilities in Log4J 2.
But we have mitigated *[supported](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr?tab=tags)* images (and some others) and re-published them.
You may need to re-pull the image you are using.
For those images prior to 8.11.1, Solr is using a popular technique to mitigate the problem -- setting `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups`.
The Solr maintainers have deemed this adequate based specifically on how Solr uses logging; it won't be adequate for all projects that use Log4J. 
canning software might alert you to the presence of an older Log4J JAR file, however it can't know if your software (Solr) uses the artifacts in a vulnerable way.
To validate the mitigation being in place, look for `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` in the Args section of Solr's front admin screen.
As of Solr 9.0.0, Solr is using Log4J 2.17.1.

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr?tab=tags) for a list of image tags available to pull.
Note that the Apache Solr project doesn't actually support any releases older than the current major release series, despite whatever tags are published.

For more information about this image and its history and all currently supported tags, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/solr`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/solr).
This image is updated via pull requests to [the `apache/solr-docker` GitHub repo](https://github.com/apache/solr-docker).
However, the `Dockerfile`s are generated from official Apache Solr releases. See [the `apache/solr` Github repo](https://github.com/apache/solr/tree/main/solr/docker)
for more information on how the Docker image is created, maintained and tested.
